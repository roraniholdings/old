<div class="content">
  <p><img src="/images/change-design.jpg" alt="clarity, alignment and action"></p>

<p>When you think about the work that you do it will almost always involve some sort of change. A change in business results, in customer sign ups, in sales, productivity, in technology or organisation structure.</p>

<p>Change cannot happen effectively unless you have all of the following factors taken care of:</p>

<ul>
<li>getting clarity about a problem and possible solutions</li>
<li>aligning stakeholders (employees and/or customers) so they have a shared view of the problem and solution</li>
<li>enabling action by those stakeholders (on-boarding, training, support, for new products or business processes)</li>
</ul>

<p>Change design is about using design to maximise each of these factors (maximum clarity, maximum alignment and maximum action).</p>

<p>Design isn&#39;t only used to make things look nice. Nice logos, nice fonts, nice colours are all fine but that&#39;s not really the type of design that you can use to create change. Design isn&#39;t just how you make something look, design is a powerful tool for solving problems and communicate with clarity.</p>

<p>There are five types of design that can be applied to any project so you can maximise clarity, alignment and action:</p>

<ul>
<li>story design</li>
<li>visual design</li>
<li>game design</li>
<li>digital design</li>
<li>design thinking</li>
</ul>

<p>Let&#39;s take a look at story design.</p>

<h2>Story design</h2>

<p>Stories add context to information. This means that they make it meaningful and memorable. To create change you need to take information about your stakeholders and be able to tell the story of what they are trying to accomplish, what pains they currently experience and what gains they can create. This increases empathy which is a key to designing some thing people actually want and need.</p>

<p>If stakeholders&#39; pains and gains are addressed by a solution then you need to be able to tell the story of how the future could be in terms of a new product, a new use of technology, a new way of working, etc. You can then test the viability, desirability and feasibility of a solution with stakeholders without having to build something. You can simply tell them a story featuring them, their problem and one possible solution.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s an example of a special type of story you can design to get clarity when you&#39;re trying to create change. It&#39;s called a problem-solution story. (It&#39;s one of the three types of stories we can use in business.)</p>

<h3>Reginald&#39;s computer</h3>

<p>A problem-solution story contrasts the problems with doing things the current way and the benefits of doing them a new way.</p>

<p><img src="/images/blog-images/broken-computer.png" alt="broken computer"></p>

<p>&quot;Reginald is a professor here at the Brookings Institute. Late one night he was busy entering all the results of his students final exams into the computer in his classroom. Unfortunately, the computer crashed and Reginald lost all his work. This made Reginald’s boss and his students very upset.</p>

<p>&quot;Reginald and his fellow professors need more reliable computer systems for working with important data like exam results.</p>

<p><img src="/images/blog-images/new-computer.png" alt="new computer"></p>

<p>“The Bookings Institute has decided to upgrade all it’s computers so they are faster and almost never crash. The Institute is also using cloud technology to store their data. This means when Reginald enters exam results they are always saved automatically. No more lost data. Best of all, Reginald can access his files in the cloud from his home computer or his mobile device.</p>

<p>Even if Reginald needs to work a bit later than usual, he can do so from the comfort of his home office. Plus get lots of work done on the train ride home.”</p>

<h3>Breakdown</h3>

<p>Here are the elements of this problem-solution story:</p>

<ul>
<li>Reginald (a person who your audience can relate to and probably wants to accomplish the same thing they do)</li>
<li>Reginald’s computer crashing (big problem)</li>
<li>Reginald’s boss and students getting upset (results of problem)</li>
<li>Faster, crash-resistant computers (proposed solution)</li>
<li>Auto-save and working remotely and on the train (benefits of changing things)</li>
</ul>

    <h1><a href="/creating-engagement/">Creating Engagement</a></h1>
    <p class="author u-c-txt">Blair wrote this on 01 Feb</p>

    <div class="entry">
      <p><img src="/images/blog-images/engagement.jpg" alt="engagement"></p>

<p>Engagement is a super important business word and at the same time it can be a pretty fluffy term.</p>

<p>What business people call engagement can be thought of as a combination of <strong>alignment</strong> and <strong>action</strong>.</p>

<h2>Alignment</h2>

<p>Everyone involved in creating change (deciders and doers) needs a shared view of the current world and how the future will be different and better. Priorities, goals, rewards, resources etc. all need to be aligned.</p>

<p>Employees and/or customers need to know what problem is being solved, what the proposed solution is and how it will make it easier to achieve a particular thing.</p>

<p>Unfortunately most businesses communication defaults to an email or maybe a town hall. Emails can have lots of important, accurate information in them. But there is just so much email. Open your work email inbox now and see for your self. How much impact will another email have? Emails clog your short terms memory and create stress with all the additional tasks they create for you to do.</p>

<p>Email is also not a highly visual medium. File size and the design tools and skills available make creating effective visual emails pretty difficult. So you&#39;re stuck with lots of important, accurate words that most people will have to ignore along with lots of other emails.</p>

<p>Change designers know that people learn and recall information much better when it is <a href="/getting-clarity-story-design/">presented as a story</a>. Can you remember any books you read or were read to you as a child? Now you don&#39;t remember the exact words, but you can probably retell the story. What about a movie you saw years ago? Brilliant. What if all business communication was just as effective. Stories can involve emotion. When we feel something we are more likely to do something (feeling angry = shouting, feeling hungry = eating, you get the idea).</p>

<p>Along with stories change designers use <a href="/visual-literacy-for-project-teams">visuals</a>. Visuals clarify what communicators mean when they are using words alone. They can also be memorable (if they are relevant vs. decorative e.g. most stock photos of hand shakes). A visual story is a powerful communication tool, far more powerful than email can ever be. Plus visual content is shared far more across today&#39;s digital networks. In fact, a picture of words in a book is often more popular than the same text copied and posted into a social network post.</p>

<h2>Action</h2>

<p>If you&#39;re in the learning and development or training industry you&#39;ll often be asked to design training. Training (think elearning, slides, user guides) are basically tools for providing information (probably with a quiz at the end). These tools typically aren&#39;t about producing action. They are focussed on compliance and telling people information before they actually need to use it.</p>

<p>Tools that enable action are used by people practising a skill in a real or simulated situation. Yes you might need to provide information to people while they are practising. The difference between traditional training and enabling action is that people are putting that info to use and referring to it where and when they need it, not just so they can click through another elearning course.</p>

<p>Change designers use stories, visual communication, games, digital technology and design thinking to create alignment.</p>

<p>A quick example that most people can relate to is a healthy diet. Yes you can read a book about healthy diets and recipes. The problem is that this is a tool for information delivery. What are you going to do next?</p>

<p>If you open your smart phone&#39;s app store and search for recipe or healthy eating apps, you not only get the recipes but often you can create a shopping list based on the ingredients you are missing from your kitchen. Then you can take you phone to the shop and tick off the missing ingredients as you buy them.</p>

<p>Then when you get home you can fire up your app and most likely watch a video of how to prepare the recipe.</p>

<p>Plus if recording exercise, weighing or measuring is part of what you&#39;re trying to achieve with your health, the healthy eating or another app can remind you to exercise and measure and even help you record you results so you can see you progress.</p>

<p>So while most businesses are in the mode of training (information delivery), tools that enable action will always be more effective at creating change because they are available in context (where and when you need them) and they provide practical information and even progress tracking.</p>
