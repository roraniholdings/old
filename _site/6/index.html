<div class="content">
  <p><img src="/images/apple-triangle.png" alt="Apple and a triangle"></p>

<p>When it comes to solving business problems it is usually quite an unstructured, messy process. One of the main reasons is that we don&#39;t have a shared language to use when discussing the change we want to see in a business. This makes it difficult, if not impossible, to get clarity on what we need to change and why.</p>

<p>You may have seen the <a href="http://img.pandawhale.com/159329-Software-Engineering-Tree-Swin-iqRE.png" target="_blank">tree swing diagram</a> depicting what often happens to most change projects.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve tried to come up with an explanation of what role a shared language can play in helping business teams get clarity when they are trying to create change. Let&#39;s look at Chefs as an example.</p>

<p>Chefs use a shared language when they solve food problems. For example, when they&#39;re designing a menu.</p>

<p>In western culture, a menu usually has three areas:</p>

<ul>
<li>entrées</li>
<li>mains</li>
<li>deserts</li>
</ul>

<p>Using design we can visualise these areas as a canvas that chefs could use to design a menu.</p>

<p><img src="/images/blank-canvas.png" alt="Blank canvas"></p>

<p>Chefs probably follow a process to make sure the menu they design will work. They start with the entrées, then mains, then deserts.</p>

<p><img src="/images/process.png" alt="process"></p>

<p>Within each area of our menu canvas there are probably some guidelines or rules for what should go in that area, what options they should consider and what makes a good dish. For example, roast pork probably goes in the <em>mains</em> area and an entrée should be a small dish and could be finger food, a soup or a salad (I&#39;m not an actual chef so apologies to all the chefs who are screwing up their eyebrows while reading this).</p>

<p><img src="/images/rules.png" alt="Rules"></p>

<p>The menu in it&#39;s current form can then be tested with customers to see if it&#39;s creating value for them. If not, it&#39;s easy to use the shared language of menu design to make improvements over time.</p>

<p>So we&#39;ve got two elements:</p>

<ul>
<li>A [design] canvas (or a visual, tactile tool)</li>
<li>A process to follow</li>
</ul>

<p>Together these elements give chefs a shared language they can use to get clarity about their work.</p>

<p><img src="/images/apple-to-apple.png" alt="Apple and apple"></p>

<p>Like chefs we too can use design canvases to solve problems and create change in our businesses. They give us a visual framework within which to brainstorm and make decisions. Most importantly they can help us get clarity, sooner, and give us something tangible to test with stakeholders, learn from and improve on.</p>

<p>PS: If you&#39;ve got a design canvas you like please tweet or email me a link with a quick blurb about how you&#39;ve used it.</p>

      <p><img src="/images/blog-images/engagement.jpg" alt="engagement"></p>

<p>Engagement is a super important business word and at the same time it can be a pretty fluffy term.</p>

<p>What business people call engagement can be thought of as a combination of <strong>alignment</strong> and <strong>action</strong>.</p>

<h2>Alignment</h2>

<p>Everyone involved in creating change (deciders and doers) needs a shared view of the current world and how the future will be different and better. Priorities, goals, rewards, resources etc. all need to be aligned.</p>

<p>Employees and/or customers need to know what problem is being solved, what the proposed solution is and how it will make it easier to achieve a particular thing.</p>

<p>Unfortunately most businesses communication defaults to an email or maybe a town hall. Emails can have lots of important, accurate information in them. But there is just so much email. Open your work email inbox now and see for your self. How much impact will another email have? Emails clog your short terms memory and create stress with all the additional tasks they create for you to do.</p>

<p>Email is also not a highly visual medium. File size and the design tools and skills available make creating effective visual emails pretty difficult. So you&#39;re stuck with lots of important, accurate words that most people will have to ignore along with lots of other emails.</p>

<p>Change designers know that people learn and recall information much better when it is <a href="/getting-clarity-story-design/">presented as a story</a>. Can you remember any books you read or were read to you as a child? Now you don&#39;t remember the exact words, but you can probably retell the story. What about a movie you saw years ago? Brilliant. What if all business communication was just as effective. Stories can involve emotion. When we feel something we are more likely to do something (feeling angry = shouting, feeling hungry = eating, you get the idea).</p>

<p>Along with stories change designers use <a href="/visual-literacy-for-project-teams">visuals</a>. Visuals clarify what communicators mean when they are using words alone. They can also be memorable (if they are relevant vs. decorative e.g. most stock photos of hand shakes). A visual story is a powerful communication tool, far more powerful than email can ever be. Plus visual content is shared far more across today&#39;s digital networks. In fact, a picture of words in a book is often more popular than the same text copied and posted into a social network post.</p>

<h2>Action</h2>

<p>If you&#39;re in the learning and development or training industry you&#39;ll often be asked to design training. Training (think elearning, slides, user guides) are basically tools for providing information (probably with a quiz at the end). These tools typically aren&#39;t about producing action. They are focussed on compliance and telling people information before they actually need to use it.</p>

<p>Tools that enable action are used by people practising a skill in a real or simulated situation. Yes you might need to provide information to people while they are practising. The difference between traditional training and enabling action is that people are putting that info to use and referring to it where and when they need it, not just so they can click through another elearning course.</p>

<p>Change designers use stories, visual communication, games, digital technology and design thinking to create alignment.</p>

<p>A quick example that most people can relate to is a healthy diet. Yes you can read a book about healthy diets and recipes. The problem is that this is a tool for information delivery. What are you going to do next?</p>

<p>If you open your smart phone&#39;s app store and search for recipe or healthy eating apps, you not only get the recipes but often you can create a shopping list based on the ingredients you are missing from your kitchen. Then you can take you phone to the shop and tick off the missing ingredients as you buy them.</p>

<p>Then when you get home you can fire up your app and most likely watch a video of how to prepare the recipe.</p>

<p>Plus if recording exercise, weighing or measuring is part of what you&#39;re trying to achieve with your health, the healthy eating or another app can remind you to exercise and measure and even help you record you results so you can see you progress.</p>

<p>So while most businesses are in the mode of training (information delivery), tools that enable action will always be more effective at creating change because they are available in context (where and when you need them) and they provide practical information and even progress tracking.</p>
