<p>When you play the board game Monopoly few things can bum you out more than landing on &quot;Go to Jail&quot;. It&#39;s not a nice place. You&#39;re basically trapped there, unable to interact with the other players until they land on the jail space to visit you. While you&#39;re in jail they&#39;re busy buying all the good properties and preparing to punish you with houses and hotels when you get out. Yuck.</p>

<p>In the real world jail is a place we put people to segregate them from everyone else and limit our interaction with them. This is usually because there is something very negative about these people&#39;s behaviour.</p>

<p>So basically jail = bad.</p>

<p>As we know we live in the information age. This is an age where the creation and sharing of information is happening at a phenomenal rate. What can&#39;t you find out simply by talking to your watch? Exactly.</p>

<p>Despite the abundance of information in existence, I&#39;ve observed that almost everything that learning and development professionals produce is effectively telling this information to &quot;Go to jail&quot;. Here&#39;s how this works.</p>

<p>Step 1: Talk to an expert.
Step 2: Simplify and chunk what they know.
Step 3: Hopefully design some visuals.
Step 4: Put this accurate, simplified, visual information into an elearning module, workshop slides, a facilitator&#39;s guide or an intranet site.
Step 5: The information is now trapped, unable to interact with people who need it unless they visit the module, workshop or intranet.</p>

<p>Pop quiz: Is information easy to find on your intranet?</p>

<p>We send information to jail when we present it in a <em>training</em> context instead of in a <em>doing</em> or using context.</p>

<p>Why? Perhaps it&#39;s because teacher&#39;s always had a book of answers or memorised answers when we were at school. Then along came the  CD-ROM and all of a sudden we could put the book of answers into a multimedia presentation on a disc and distribute the disc. The internet allowed us to distribute the same multimedia presentations to more people with greater ease. We decided that we should track who had accessed these presentations (now called online courses) and so we put the into database called an LMS. Of course we still need workshops too so we often put the info from the course into PowerPoint instead and read it out to people then we quiz them on what we just read.</p>

<p>None of this is inherently evil. Until you need to access some of the information sometime in the future.</p>

<p>All the scenarios listed above are training contexts. We leave the real world of our job,  fly to head office, stay over night and attend a two-day seminar. Attending seminars isn&#39;t part of our job nor does the seminar necessarily include practising your job in a meaningful way. Again, it&#39;s a training context. Or we click through an elearning course that is basically the same thing as the seminar only shorter and with drag and drop interactions.</p>

<p>We actually need to use the information we are presented in a training context (well some of it) in a doing context i.e. when doing our jobs. So how do we get it? The instructions I need are on screen 18 of the elearning course or were explained after lunch on day two of the workshop and the trainer wrote some notes on a flip chart to summarise. How can I get that information from the training context into a doing context? For the most part it&#39;s trapped. Or it&#39;s on the intranet which, let&#39;s face it, is basically the same situation.</p>

<p>No matter how accurate or interesting or well presented or interactive the information was, we simply sent it to jail. It&#39;s isolated from the real world. Timely access to information when
and where we need it (in context) is critical to success and survival
in today&#39;s fast-paced world. It is often easy to access information that isn&#39;t required to do our jobs from a computer or device with an internet connection. For example, the result of a big sports event or news about a celebrity. You can find a video about anything on YouTube . Although we don&#39;t necessarily need this information we can access it when and where we want it (in context).</p>

<p>So for me the question is: How can we make access to information in a doing context at work just as easy as it is at home? Or in other words: Let&#39;s find new models for the work L and D produce and set
all that information free!</p>
