<div class="content">
  <p><img src="/images/go-to-jail.png" alt="Go to jail"></p>

<p>When you play the board game Monopoly few things can bum you out more than landing on &quot;Go to Jail&quot;. It&#39;s not a nice place. You&#39;re basically trapped there, unable to interact with the other players until they land on the jail space to visit you. While you&#39;re in jail they&#39;re busy buying all the good properties and preparing to punish you with houses and hotels when you get out. Yuck.</p>

<p>In the real world jail is a place we put people to segregate them from everyone else and limit our interaction with them. This is usually because there is something very negative about these people&#39;s behaviour.</p>

<p>So basically jail = bad.</p>

<p>As we know we live in the information age. This is an age where the creation and sharing of information is happening at a phenomenal rate. What can&#39;t you find out simply by talking to your watch? Exactly.</p>

<p>Despite the abundance of information in existence, I&#39;ve observed that almost everything that learning and development professionals produce is effectively telling this information to &quot;Go to jail&quot;. Here&#39;s how this works.</p>

<p>Step 1: Talk to an expert.
Step 2: Simplify and chunk what they know.
Step 3: Hopefully design some visuals.
Step 4: Put this accurate, simplified, visual information into an elearning module, workshop slides, a facilitator&#39;s guide or an intranet site.
Step 5: The information is now trapped, unable to interact with people who need it unless they visit the module, workshop or intranet.</p>

<p>Pop quiz: Is information easy to find on your intranet?</p>

<p>We send information to jail when we present it in a <em>training</em> context instead of in a <em>doing</em> or using context.</p>

<p>Why? Perhaps it&#39;s because teacher&#39;s always had a book of answers or memorised answers when we were at school. Then along came the  CD-ROM and all of a sudden we could put the book of answers into a multimedia presentation on a disc and distribute the disc. The internet allowed us to distribute the same multimedia presentations to more people with greater ease. We decided that we should track who had accessed these presentations (now called online courses) and so we put the into database called an LMS. Of course we still need workshops too so we often put the info from the course into PowerPoint instead and read it out to people then we quiz them on what we just read.</p>

<p>None of this is inherently evil. Until you need to access some of the information sometime in the future.</p>

<p>All the scenarios listed above are training contexts. We leave the real world of our job,  fly to head office, stay over night and attend a two-day seminar. Attending seminars isn&#39;t part of our job nor does the seminar necessarily include practising your job in a meaningful way. Again, it&#39;s a training context. Or we click through an elearning course that is basically the same thing as the seminar only shorter and with drag and drop interactions.</p>

<p>We actually need to use the information we are presented in a training context (well some of it) in a doing context i.e. when doing our jobs. So how do we get it? The instructions I need are on screen 18 of the elearning course or were explained after lunch on day two of the workshop and the trainer wrote some notes on a flip chart to summarise. How can I get that information from the training context into a doing context? For the most part it&#39;s trapped. Or it&#39;s on the intranet which, let&#39;s face it, is basically the same situation.</p>

<p>No matter how accurate or interesting or well presented or interactive the information was, we simply sent it to jail. It&#39;s isolated from the real world. Timely access to information when
and where we need it (in context) is critical to success and survival
in today&#39;s fast-paced world. It is often easy to access information that isn&#39;t required to do our jobs from a computer or device with an internet connection. For example, the result of a big sports event or news about a celebrity. You can find a video about anything on YouTube . Although we don&#39;t necessarily need this information we can access it when and where we want it (in context).</p>

<p>So for me the question is: How can we make access to information in a doing context at work just as easy as it is at home? Or in other words: Let&#39;s find new models for the work L and D produce and set
all that information free!</p>

    <h1><a href="/creating-engagement/">Creating Engagement</a></h1>
    <p class="author u-c-txt">Blair wrote this on 01 Feb</p>

    <div class="entry">
      <p><img src="/images/blog-images/engagement.jpg" alt="engagement"></p>

<p>Engagement is a super important business word and at the same time it can be a pretty fluffy term.</p>

<p>What business people call engagement can be thought of as a combination of <strong>alignment</strong> and <strong>action</strong>.</p>

<h2>Alignment</h2>

<p>Everyone involved in creating change (deciders and doers) needs a shared view of the current world and how the future will be different and better. Priorities, goals, rewards, resources etc. all need to be aligned.</p>

<p>Employees and/or customers need to know what problem is being solved, what the proposed solution is and how it will make it easier to achieve a particular thing.</p>

<p>Unfortunately most businesses communication defaults to an email or maybe a town hall. Emails can have lots of important, accurate information in them. But there is just so much email. Open your work email inbox now and see for your self. How much impact will another email have? Emails clog your short terms memory and create stress with all the additional tasks they create for you to do.</p>

<p>Email is also not a highly visual medium. File size and the design tools and skills available make creating effective visual emails pretty difficult. So you&#39;re stuck with lots of important, accurate words that most people will have to ignore along with lots of other emails.</p>

<p>Change designers know that people learn and recall information much better when it is <a href="/getting-clarity-story-design/">presented as a story</a>. Can you remember any books you read or were read to you as a child? Now you don&#39;t remember the exact words, but you can probably retell the story. What about a movie you saw years ago? Brilliant. What if all business communication was just as effective. Stories can involve emotion. When we feel something we are more likely to do something (feeling angry = shouting, feeling hungry = eating, you get the idea).</p>

<p>Along with stories change designers use <a href="/visual-literacy-for-project-teams">visuals</a>. Visuals clarify what communicators mean when they are using words alone. They can also be memorable (if they are relevant vs. decorative e.g. most stock photos of hand shakes). A visual story is a powerful communication tool, far more powerful than email can ever be. Plus visual content is shared far more across today&#39;s digital networks. In fact, a picture of words in a book is often more popular than the same text copied and posted into a social network post.</p>

<h2>Action</h2>

<p>If you&#39;re in the learning and development or training industry you&#39;ll often be asked to design training. Training (think elearning, slides, user guides) are basically tools for providing information (probably with a quiz at the end). These tools typically aren&#39;t about producing action. They are focussed on compliance and telling people information before they actually need to use it.</p>

<p>Tools that enable action are used by people practising a skill in a real or simulated situation. Yes you might need to provide information to people while they are practising. The difference between traditional training and enabling action is that people are putting that info to use and referring to it where and when they need it, not just so they can click through another elearning course.</p>

<p>Change designers use stories, visual communication, games, digital technology and design thinking to create alignment.</p>

<p>A quick example that most people can relate to is a healthy diet. Yes you can read a book about healthy diets and recipes. The problem is that this is a tool for information delivery. What are you going to do next?</p>

<p>If you open your smart phone&#39;s app store and search for recipe or healthy eating apps, you not only get the recipes but often you can create a shopping list based on the ingredients you are missing from your kitchen. Then you can take you phone to the shop and tick off the missing ingredients as you buy them.</p>

<p>Then when you get home you can fire up your app and most likely watch a video of how to prepare the recipe.</p>

<p>Plus if recording exercise, weighing or measuring is part of what you&#39;re trying to achieve with your health, the healthy eating or another app can remind you to exercise and measure and even help you record you results so you can see you progress.</p>

<p>So while most businesses are in the mode of training (information delivery), tools that enable action will always be more effective at creating change because they are available in context (where and when you need them) and they provide practical information and even progress tracking.</p>
