<h1 class="u-c-txt"><a href="/Doing-nothing-vs.-doing-everything/">Doing nothing vs. doing everything</a></h1>

<div class="content">
  <p>There are two ends to the instructional design spectrum:</p>

<ul>
<li>doing nothing</li>
<li>doing everything.</li>
</ul>

<p>Let’s take a closer look.</p>

<h2>Doing nothing</h2>

<p>Regardless of whether or not a new product, process, or policy is easy to learn you can always just leave learners (a.k.a. users, team members, customers, etc) to figure it out on their own. Here’s how:</p>

<p>Do nothing.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p></p>

<p>Now this might work. However, people often have some questions they need answering when they are learning something new. If something is too complicated they will probably get frustrated and give up. Also, if they make a mistake it could cause big problems and cost big money.</p>

<p>Doing nothing probably isn’t the best option a lot of the time. This approach relies on learners being motivated and confident enough to figure things out on their own. They have to be patient, actually have the time to experiment, and can’t be afraid of failure.</p>

<p>Doing nothing might work if your goal is to teach people how to search the internet for ‘funny cat videos’. This is because:</p>

<ul>
<li>Google Search is super easy - you just type</li>
<li>If you’re searching for &#39;funny cat videos&#39; you definitely have lots of time on your hands.</li>
<li>Also, very little can go wrong if you fail (other than your Facebook page won’t be quite as exciting).</li>
</ul>

<p>So what’s at the other end of the instructional design spectrum?</p>

<h2>Doing everything</h2>

<p>With all the problems and risks associated with <em>doing nothing</em>, maybe the best approach is to just do absolutely everything. Here’s what that looks like:</p>

<ul>
<li>Sending lots of emails with key information</li>
<li>Designing lots of PowerPoint slides with plenty of bullet points</li>
<li>Booking all your learners into full-day, face-to-face workshops</li>
<li>Running webinars to reinforce the workshops</li>
<li>Putting all the rules and instructions in elearning modules, and putting the elearning modules on your LMS</li>
<li>Adding quizzes to test people on their knowledge of the rules and instructions</li>
<li>Identifying the top 50 frequently asked questions and putting them into an FAQs resource</li>
<li>Making all the business process maps available on a shared drive</li>
</ul>

<p>All of these activities make it virtually impossible for learners to say, “I didn’t know what to do.” Which seems like a good thing.</p>

<p>Here’s what’s wrong with the <em>doing everything</em> approach: it’s almost always based on untested assumptions. Here are just a few of those assumptions:</p>

<ul>
<li>no learners have prior experience with this topic</li>
<li>no learners can figure even part of this thing out on their own</li>
<li>if something is complex then the only way to learn it is in a face-to-face workshop</li>
<li>beginners often need more information so we better give them all the information just in case</li>
<li>the more frequently asked questions the better</li>
<li>business analysts aren’t the only ones that read the process maps they create</li>
<li>most learners read, save, and refer back to important emails (and have an efficient system for doing so)</li>
</ul>

<p>Now some of those assumptions may actually be correct. But think about your last project. How much time did you spend validating that email is an effective communication method? How did you validate this? What data did you collect? What about any of the other assumptions above? By validating, I don’t mean asking a manager. You actually need to talk to real learners, and observe what they normally do. Managers are busy and often only have time to give you the status quo response. In that case you then end up designing something that just meets the status quo.</p>

<p>In the event that one of the above is not correct, then the <em>doing everything</em> approach will result in wasted time and budget designing things that either won’t be used and/or won’t work.</p>

<h2>So what’s the answer?</h2>

<p>Yes beginners will always need some FAQs answering. They may need to spend some time talking with an expert. Webinars are super popular these days. This means that the <em>do nothing</em> approach to instructional design will rarely be the best one. However, jumping straight to the opposite end of the spectrum isn’t the right choice either. Instead it’s about finding middle ground.</p>

<p>The best way to do this is to start by asking, “What if we did nothing?” knowing full well that this won’t be appropriate. But then you should imagine that you’re an inch worm and take teeny, tiny steps from <em>doing nothing</em> towards the other end of the spectrum. You do this by validating and testing every assumption starting with the most time consuming and expensive solutions.</p>

<p>Your focus should be to design the absolute minimum viable solution, one that will meet the needs of the majority of your learners. For example, the results of your learner research might be that although a new CRM system is being rolled out, learners have experience using it’s core features because they have used CRMs before. This may mean a quick reference guide and some videos of how to use the CRM are all that you need. Again, only interviewing and observing will tell you what solution will work best, not assumptions based on the way things have always been done.</p>

<h2>Take aways</h2>

<ul>
<li>Don’t assume the <em>doing everything</em> approach is the right one.</li>
<li>Validate your assumptions, especially if things have always been done a certain way.</li>
<li>Start with <em>doing nothing</em> and only add what is absolutely necessary to design the minimum viable solution.</li>
<li>Design less!</li>
</ul>

    <h1><a href="/creating-engagement/">Creating Engagement</a></h1>
    <p class="author u-c-txt">Blair wrote this on 01 Feb</p>

    <div class="entry">
      <p><img src="/images/blog-images/engagement.jpg" alt="engagement"></p>

<p>Engagement is a super important business word and at the same time it can be a pretty fluffy term.</p>

<p>What business people call engagement can be thought of as a combination of <strong>alignment</strong> and <strong>action</strong>.</p>

<h2>Alignment</h2>

<p>Everyone involved in creating change (deciders and doers) needs a shared view of the current world and how the future will be different and better. Priorities, goals, rewards, resources etc. all need to be aligned.</p>

<p>Employees and/or customers need to know what problem is being solved, what the proposed solution is and how it will make it easier to achieve a particular thing.</p>

<p>Unfortunately most businesses communication defaults to an email or maybe a town hall. Emails can have lots of important, accurate information in them. But there is just so much email. Open your work email inbox now and see for your self. How much impact will another email have? Emails clog your short terms memory and create stress with all the additional tasks they create for you to do.</p>

<p>Email is also not a highly visual medium. File size and the design tools and skills available make creating effective visual emails pretty difficult. So you&#39;re stuck with lots of important, accurate words that most people will have to ignore along with lots of other emails.</p>

<p>Change designers know that people learn and recall information much better when it is <a href="/getting-clarity-story-design/">presented as a story</a>. Can you remember any books you read or were read to you as a child? Now you don&#39;t remember the exact words, but you can probably retell the story. What about a movie you saw years ago? Brilliant. What if all business communication was just as effective. Stories can involve emotion. When we feel something we are more likely to do something (feeling angry = shouting, feeling hungry = eating, you get the idea).</p>

<p>Along with stories change designers use <a href="/visual-literacy-for-project-teams">visuals</a>. Visuals clarify what communicators mean when they are using words alone. They can also be memorable (if they are relevant vs. decorative e.g. most stock photos of hand shakes). A visual story is a powerful communication tool, far more powerful than email can ever be. Plus visual content is shared far more across today&#39;s digital networks. In fact, a picture of words in a book is often more popular than the same text copied and posted into a social network post.</p>

<h2>Action</h2>

<p>If you&#39;re in the learning and development or training industry you&#39;ll often be asked to design training. Training (think elearning, slides, user guides) are basically tools for providing information (probably with a quiz at the end). These tools typically aren&#39;t about producing action. They are focussed on compliance and telling people information before they actually need to use it.</p>

<p>Tools that enable action are used by people practising a skill in a real or simulated situation. Yes you might need to provide information to people while they are practising. The difference between traditional training and enabling action is that people are putting that info to use and referring to it where and when they need it, not just so they can click through another elearning course.</p>

<p>Change designers use stories, visual communication, games, digital technology and design thinking to create alignment.</p>

<p>A quick example that most people can relate to is a healthy diet. Yes you can read a book about healthy diets and recipes. The problem is that this is a tool for information delivery. What are you going to do next?</p>

<p>If you open your smart phone&#39;s app store and search for recipe or healthy eating apps, you not only get the recipes but often you can create a shopping list based on the ingredients you are missing from your kitchen. Then you can take you phone to the shop and tick off the missing ingredients as you buy them.</p>

<p>Then when you get home you can fire up your app and most likely watch a video of how to prepare the recipe.</p>

<p>Plus if recording exercise, weighing or measuring is part of what you&#39;re trying to achieve with your health, the healthy eating or another app can remind you to exercise and measure and even help you record you results so you can see you progress.</p>

<p>So while most businesses are in the mode of training (information delivery), tools that enable action will always be more effective at creating change because they are available in context (where and when you need them) and they provide practical information and even progress tracking.</p>
