<div class="content">
  <p><img src="https://db.tt/OYuYYVE1" alt="Push Button Creativity"></p>

<p>Like many of you, I&#39;ve been to a few learning and development events over the years. It&#39;s always interesting to me to observe the general desire for what I like to call <em>push button creativity</em>.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s how that goes.</p>

<p>You&#39;re at a conference and one of the speakers talks about this tool they discovered that allows you to do something like create animations or turn photos into cartoons or whatever. Cool right? Plus, the speaker points out that this tool is free to download.</p>

<p>This is also true of templates, icons, stock photography and so on. Someone else does the creative work and you download it, change a few words or colours and the pass it off as your own work.</p>

<p>And there you have it: push button creativity.</p>

<h2>What is wrong with this?</h2>

<p>While not everyone is <em>creative</em> (meaning that they have the skills to create something, not that they like to use lots of different colours) I think it is strange that people want to find tools that actually do creativity for them. In other words, they are outsourcing all the creative decision making and creative work to some software or another designer.</p>

<p>If that&#39;s where we&#39;re heading, will we reach the point where the head of HR (who typically hires other people to do creative work) just buys the software, presses a button themselves and all the creative work is done?</p>

<p>I should mention that these push button creativity tools exist in many industries, e.g. web design, app development. There is also a difference between tools that help you apply best practices consistently vs. ones that do the creative stuff for you. If push button creativity is the way that you work how valuable are you becoming to your company?</p>

<p>Of course the inevitable problem is that we all start using push button creativity and everything looks the same. A classic example is when a friend and I were pitching for a project and my friend pointed out that an elearning module we were asked to redesign looked identical to another totally unrelated project he had been involved in. It turns out there was a menu template provided in that particular software and the designers of these respective courses had used the exact same template. Is this creative work? The same problem arises with animations, icons, and stock photos.</p>

<p>To compound the push button creativity trend, it also seems desirable, if not expected, that such tools should be free. &quot;Check out this free tool that turns any Word document into an animated tree frog. Plus it runs on iPads.&quot; Yes I made that up but it&#39;s not far from what many of us have heard from one too many conference speakers. So we&#39;re basically saying that we want to push a button in a tool and get our creative work done for us.  We also expect such a tool to cost $0. To make matters worse if push button creativity tools aren&#39;t free, we find ways to not pay for them. So basically software piracy. Yet we charge our clients or our employers for our time and effort.</p>

<p>Which brings me to my main point.</p>

<p>It isn&#39;t so much that some people want to be instructional / training / learning designers who find ways around doing actual design. It&#39;s more the attitude of wanting something for nothing. It&#39;s about putting the minimum effort (and expense) into a design task and expecting good results. Is this where we want the L and D (or any) industry to end up? I don&#39;t think it is.</p>

<h2>So where to from here?</h2>

<p>You can start to change things today from the comfort of your own desk. Try these suggestions.</p>

<h3>Start learning a new creative skill</h3>

<p>The irony of this push button creativity trend is that we also live in the era push button learning. Thanks to the internet, it&#39;s easier than it&#39;s ever been to learn skills like photography, HTML, vector illustration, JavaScript, video production, animation, etc. It might cost you $15-25 per month. Pay for it out of your own pocket if you have to. It&#39;s cheaper than a coffee a day and more valuable than most of the stuff you paid to learn at university.</p>

<p><strong>Resources</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://teamtreehouse.com">Treehouse</a></li>
<li><a href="http://tutsplus.com/">Tuts+</a></li>
<li><a href="http://lynda.com">Lynda</a></li>
<li><a href="http://google.com">Google Search</a></li>
</ul>

<h3>Pay for everything</h3>

<p>We all have different values. If you&#39;re honest then you&#39;re honest. The opposite is also true and that&#39;s a personal choice. You expect to be paid for the work you do because you believe it&#39;s valuable. The people who build software and templates and stock art believe their work is valuable too. Pay them just like you&#39;re getting paid.</p>

<h3>Acknowledge creativity</h3>

<p>If you do use push button creativity tools make sure you acknowledge this. Either in your code comments, or a footer of a web site or somewhere. Especially to your client or your manager who is paying you to do creative work. You&#39;re not out to get a pay cut or get fired. You&#39;re simply being transparent about how you&#39;re producing your work. (I don&#39;t know for sure, but I imagine it would uncomfortable to pass off push button creativity as your own work only to have a client or manager discover this for themselves and question you about it.)</p>

    <p class="author u-c-txt">Blair wrote this on 01 Feb</p>

    <div class="entry">
      <p><img src="/images/blog-images/engagement.jpg" alt="engagement"></p>

<p>Engagement is a super important business word and at the same time it can be a pretty fluffy term.</p>

<p>What business people call engagement can be thought of as a combination of <strong>alignment</strong> and <strong>action</strong>.</p>

<h2>Alignment</h2>

<p>Everyone involved in creating change (deciders and doers) needs a shared view of the current world and how the future will be different and better. Priorities, goals, rewards, resources etc. all need to be aligned.</p>

<p>Employees and/or customers need to know what problem is being solved, what the proposed solution is and how it will make it easier to achieve a particular thing.</p>

<p>Unfortunately most businesses communication defaults to an email or maybe a town hall. Emails can have lots of important, accurate information in them. But there is just so much email. Open your work email inbox now and see for your self. How much impact will another email have? Emails clog your short terms memory and create stress with all the additional tasks they create for you to do.</p>

<p>Email is also not a highly visual medium. File size and the design tools and skills available make creating effective visual emails pretty difficult. So you&#39;re stuck with lots of important, accurate words that most people will have to ignore along with lots of other emails.</p>

<p>Change designers know that people learn and recall information much better when it is <a href="/getting-clarity-story-design/">presented as a story</a>. Can you remember any books you read or were read to you as a child? Now you don&#39;t remember the exact words, but you can probably retell the story. What about a movie you saw years ago? Brilliant. What if all business communication was just as effective. Stories can involve emotion. When we feel something we are more likely to do something (feeling angry = shouting, feeling hungry = eating, you get the idea).</p>

<p>Along with stories change designers use <a href="/visual-literacy-for-project-teams">visuals</a>. Visuals clarify what communicators mean when they are using words alone. They can also be memorable (if they are relevant vs. decorative e.g. most stock photos of hand shakes). A visual story is a powerful communication tool, far more powerful than email can ever be. Plus visual content is shared far more across today&#39;s digital networks. In fact, a picture of words in a book is often more popular than the same text copied and posted into a social network post.</p>

<h2>Action</h2>

<p>If you&#39;re in the learning and development or training industry you&#39;ll often be asked to design training. Training (think elearning, slides, user guides) are basically tools for providing information (probably with a quiz at the end). These tools typically aren&#39;t about producing action. They are focussed on compliance and telling people information before they actually need to use it.</p>

<p>Tools that enable action are used by people practising a skill in a real or simulated situation. Yes you might need to provide information to people while they are practising. The difference between traditional training and enabling action is that people are putting that info to use and referring to it where and when they need it, not just so they can click through another elearning course.</p>

<p>Change designers use stories, visual communication, games, digital technology and design thinking to create alignment.</p>

<p>A quick example that most people can relate to is a healthy diet. Yes you can read a book about healthy diets and recipes. The problem is that this is a tool for information delivery. What are you going to do next?</p>

<p>If you open your smart phone&#39;s app store and search for recipe or healthy eating apps, you not only get the recipes but often you can create a shopping list based on the ingredients you are missing from your kitchen. Then you can take you phone to the shop and tick off the missing ingredients as you buy them.</p>

<p>Then when you get home you can fire up your app and most likely watch a video of how to prepare the recipe.</p>

<p>Plus if recording exercise, weighing or measuring is part of what you&#39;re trying to achieve with your health, the healthy eating or another app can remind you to exercise and measure and even help you record you results so you can see you progress.</p>

<p>So while most businesses are in the mode of training (information delivery), tools that enable action will always be more effective at creating change because they are available in context (where and when you need them) and they provide practical information and even progress tracking.</p>
