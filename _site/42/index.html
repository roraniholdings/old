<div class="content">
  <p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instructional_design">Instructional design</a> is the practice of creating “instructional experiences which make the acquisition of knowledge and skill more efficient, effective, and, appealing”.</p>

<h2>We called it <em>elearning</em></h2>

<p>An ‘instructional experience’ is an experience that gives us the instructions. Traditionally this happens by a trainer deciding what should be taught and explaining it to a class of learners then giving them a quiz.</p>

<p>At some point everyone decided it was cheaper to do this using computers, so the information presentations and quizzes were put online and we called it <em>elearning</em>.</p>

<p>It didn’t take long for learners to figure out that this was almost as boring as listening to a trainer. We then decided to add interactivity to elearning. This took many forms. For example, clicking a button to reveal information that was previously hidden, or, hovering your mouse over a button to produce the same effect. Then there was the popular cover flow interaction (like flicking through your albums on your iPod). Another interaction one was filling in the blanks using a drop-down selection or dragging and dropping words to complete statements.</p>

<p>Often this type of interactivity was used in quiz questions. Apart from the good old multi-choice, there were drag-and-drop questions, sorting, and matching ones too.</p>

<p>Still, the basic effect was information presentation followed by a quiz.</p>

<p>Calling the output of instructional design &#39;elearning&#39; means we’re focussing only on what is possible using technology and not how people actually get better at things. We all know that after years of information presentation and quizzes at school (we called them tests), that we still couldn’t get a real job right away because we had no skills (practical experience applying knowledge).</p>

<h2>How is this supposed to work?</h2>

<p>So back to our definition: instructional experiences “which make the acquisition of knowledge and skill more efficient, effective, and, appealing”. Knowledge is acquired by repetition and skills are acquired by practice. Any instructional experiences that are created by instructional designers must therefore include repetition and practice.</p>

<p>Repetition doesn’t need to mean memorising only. We can repeatedly apply knowledge to real(istic) situations. In other words, we can do something with the knowledge. Children can often recite times tables, but can’t figure out how much change they should get at the supermarket or how many minutes until a boring car trip ends. This is because they usually practice memorisation instead of application. Which is more useful? Again, we come back to being able to do something. The best way to acquire knowledge is by doing something with it, or <em>learning-by-doing</em> for short.</p>

<p>The same is true of acquiring skills. We need real(istic) practice in order to get better any anything. Learning-by-doing wins again.</p>

<p>The efficiency of acquiring knowledge and skills can be definitely be increased using technology. Steve Jobs said:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“A computer is like a bicycle for our minds”.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This means that just as bicycles make human transport more efficient, computers can make activities like learning more efficient.</p>

<p>However, what we have come to know and love as elearning cannot be the answer (at least not in its current form) unless it focusses on learning-by-doing. Which it almost never does.</p>

<p>One way to think about this is to ask, “If a person wanting to get better at XYZ had to figure it out on their own, how successful would they be?” Results would vary wildly depending on the learner. At the other end of the spectrum, we can be pretty sure that almost everyone would benefit from having a more “efficient, effective and, appealing” instructional experience. This means we need an instructional designer to create an “instructional experience” of some kind.</p>

<p>Which sounds great. However, the reason we have what we currently have for “instructional experiences” is because instructional designers usually respond by doing the following. We assume that learners, especially adults, can’t possibly figure anything out on their own. So we cram as much information as possible into a facilitated workshop, an elearning module, or a webinar (yes, information presentation again) and add a quiz to make sure they memorised the information, or can at least recall it long enough to pass the quiz.</p>

<p>Of course they won’t have any new skills at the end of it all because they did basically zero practice. And they didn’t acquire knowledge by repeatedly applying it to real(istic) situations, so they will forget most of what they recalled in the quiz.</p>

<p>Is this “efficient, effective and, appealing”? I’ll let you answer that for yourself.</p>

<h2>Learning by doing</h2>

<p>The takeaway is that people learn best by <em>doing</em>. Unless an instructional experience is focussed on this, then it’s probably not much better than letting them figure things out on their own with some help from Google and YouTube.</p>

    <h1><a href="/creating-engagement/">Creating Engagement</a></h1>
    <p class="author u-c-txt">Blair wrote this on 01 Feb</p>

    <div class="entry">
      <p><img src="/images/blog-images/engagement.jpg" alt="engagement"></p>

<p>Engagement is a super important business word and at the same time it can be a pretty fluffy term.</p>

<p>What business people call engagement can be thought of as a combination of <strong>alignment</strong> and <strong>action</strong>.</p>

<h2>Alignment</h2>

<p>Everyone involved in creating change (deciders and doers) needs a shared view of the current world and how the future will be different and better. Priorities, goals, rewards, resources etc. all need to be aligned.</p>

<p>Employees and/or customers need to know what problem is being solved, what the proposed solution is and how it will make it easier to achieve a particular thing.</p>

<p>Unfortunately most businesses communication defaults to an email or maybe a town hall. Emails can have lots of important, accurate information in them. But there is just so much email. Open your work email inbox now and see for your self. How much impact will another email have? Emails clog your short terms memory and create stress with all the additional tasks they create for you to do.</p>

<p>Email is also not a highly visual medium. File size and the design tools and skills available make creating effective visual emails pretty difficult. So you&#39;re stuck with lots of important, accurate words that most people will have to ignore along with lots of other emails.</p>

<p>Change designers know that people learn and recall information much better when it is <a href="/getting-clarity-story-design/">presented as a story</a>. Can you remember any books you read or were read to you as a child? Now you don&#39;t remember the exact words, but you can probably retell the story. What about a movie you saw years ago? Brilliant. What if all business communication was just as effective. Stories can involve emotion. When we feel something we are more likely to do something (feeling angry = shouting, feeling hungry = eating, you get the idea).</p>

<p>Along with stories change designers use <a href="/visual-literacy-for-project-teams">visuals</a>. Visuals clarify what communicators mean when they are using words alone. They can also be memorable (if they are relevant vs. decorative e.g. most stock photos of hand shakes). A visual story is a powerful communication tool, far more powerful than email can ever be. Plus visual content is shared far more across today&#39;s digital networks. In fact, a picture of words in a book is often more popular than the same text copied and posted into a social network post.</p>

<h2>Action</h2>

<p>If you&#39;re in the learning and development or training industry you&#39;ll often be asked to design training. Training (think elearning, slides, user guides) are basically tools for providing information (probably with a quiz at the end). These tools typically aren&#39;t about producing action. They are focussed on compliance and telling people information before they actually need to use it.</p>

<p>Tools that enable action are used by people practising a skill in a real or simulated situation. Yes you might need to provide information to people while they are practising. The difference between traditional training and enabling action is that people are putting that info to use and referring to it where and when they need it, not just so they can click through another elearning course.</p>

<p>Change designers use stories, visual communication, games, digital technology and design thinking to create alignment.</p>

<p>A quick example that most people can relate to is a healthy diet. Yes you can read a book about healthy diets and recipes. The problem is that this is a tool for information delivery. What are you going to do next?</p>

<p>If you open your smart phone&#39;s app store and search for recipe or healthy eating apps, you not only get the recipes but often you can create a shopping list based on the ingredients you are missing from your kitchen. Then you can take you phone to the shop and tick off the missing ingredients as you buy them.</p>

<p>Then when you get home you can fire up your app and most likely watch a video of how to prepare the recipe.</p>

<p>Plus if recording exercise, weighing or measuring is part of what you&#39;re trying to achieve with your health, the healthy eating or another app can remind you to exercise and measure and even help you record you results so you can see you progress.</p>

<p>So while most businesses are in the mode of training (information delivery), tools that enable action will always be more effective at creating change because they are available in context (where and when you need them) and they provide practical information and even progress tracking.</p>
